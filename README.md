It's snake. But *snek*. In **Python**. It supports all OSes that Python can run on, and was designed to look like a retro game from the early 80s. It runs entirely in your terminal, no GUI libraries required, and uses minimal external dependencies (just `colorama`).

The world width and height is automatically set to the maximum it can be for the size of terminal it is running in, and supports recalibrating when the terminal is resized. Currently the only ways to die are by hitting the world borders, or hitting the snake's body, in which case the score (but not high score), will reset.

## Installation

> [!NOTE]\
> Please make sure you have support for Unicode fonts enabled in your system's settings. If you don't, the game will not look as it should.
